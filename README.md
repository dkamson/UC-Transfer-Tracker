# UC-MJC Transfer Tracker

### [In Development]

A web application built with Python and Streamlit to simplify the complex UC transfer process for Modesto Junior College students.

## Problem

As a current MJC student, I found the process of tracking IGETC and major-specific requirements for multiple UCs to be manual, confusing, and stressful. It's difficult to know your exact progress for different schools.

## Solution

This tool allows students to:
* Select their target UCs and CS major.
* Check off the IGETC and major-prep courses they have completed.
* Instantly see their progress (e.g., "80% complete for UC Davis") in a simple, visual way.

This project is currently being built to automate this process and provide a clear path to transfer.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Framework:** Streamlit
* **Libraries:** Pandas (for data management)

## Current Status
* Project architecture is being designed.
* Building the core UI and course-tracking logic.
